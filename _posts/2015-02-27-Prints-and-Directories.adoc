= Prints and Directories

== We've got words \(^ . ^)/

Thats right. We have printf statements. rumpuser_dprintf statements to be exact. +

_[Top left box] Prints everytime the program fetches memory from the system_

*What does this mean?* +
All computer programs have a standard output. For software that does not have a GUI, _Graphical User Interface_, this standard output is usually the terminal. Any new cyberpunk's first program is the famous helloworld program. The goal: Print out "Hello World!" to the standard output. This basic goal  has been achieved for our rump kernel implementation.

*Why Is This Important* +
While fundemental and useful only for further development and debugging,  attempting to get basic print statements has lead the rump kernel research team to attain serveral more important goals:

- Tackle a daunting directory structure
- Learn how to propperly compile and reinstall <<Rump Components>>
- Setup a working, productive development environment

_Such productivity_

== Rump Components

*It all Stems from NetBSD* +
Development starts with the *rumprun_posix* link:https://github.com/rumpkernel/rumprun-posix[repository].
