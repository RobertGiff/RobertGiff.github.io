= Prints and Directories

== We've got words \(^ . ^)/

Thats right. We have printf statements. rumpuser_dprintf statements to be exact. +

_[Top left box] Prints everytime the program fetches memory from the system_

*What does this mean?* +
All computer programs have a standard output. For software that does not have a GUI, _Graphical User Interface_, this standard output is usually the terminal. Any new cyberpunk's first program is the famous helloworld program. The goal: Print out "Hello World!" to the standard output. This basic goal  has been achieved for our rump kernel implementation.

*Why Is This Important* +
While fundemental and useful only for further development and debugging,  attempting to get basic print statements has lead the rump kernel research team to attain serveral more important goals:

- Tackle a daunting <<Directory Structure>>
- Learn how to propperly compile and reinstall rump components
- Setup a working, productive development environment

_Such productivity_

== Directory Structure

*It all Stems from NetBSD* +
Development starts with the *rumprun_posix* link:https://github.com/rumpkernel/rumprun-posix[repository]. Cloning this repository provides code to both run a rumpkernel on a posix based environment (Linux) as well as a code directory for editing the NetBSD components.

This development directory is named *buildrump.sh*. This directory will be used regardless of the hosting platform. Whether it a posix environment, Xen, raw hardware, or any other platform, all have a buildrump directory where NetBSD is modified to create unique rump components. These components are then hosted through the _rump_server_ program (also provided by buildrump). _rump_server_ takes the desired rump components and creates a server within the host computer. Being able to comunicate with this server differs from platform to platform, this is where the *rumprun_posix* comes into play.

*rumprun_posix* provides the necessary code to comunicate with _rump_server_. It provides _rumpremote_ which connects the the server through a socket. Commands can then be issued through the socket and you can begin to debug and test your components. 

Moving forrward, *rumprun_posix* will eventually replaced with baremetal and many parts of the NetBSD code within *buildrump.sh* will be replaced with Composite equivalent functions, or simply removed for lack of necessity.

=== Technical Notes (Subject to change with further research)

*Compilation* +
All non dependent components are stored within buildrump.sh/src/lib. This means that these components do not require outside NetBSD code to be hosted within rump_server. Thus compiling of these components takes place within this directory stucture.

All depend components need to be found within buildrump.sh/src/sys/... (for source code) and buildrump.sh/src/sys/rump... for the equivalent compilation directory. You must be within the rump subdirectory as there is a Makefile that fetches addition NetBSD code for the compilation to take place.
